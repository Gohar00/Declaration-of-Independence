# Usage
1. Install PyPDF2
2. Download the US_Declaration.pdf file and save it in the same directory as main.py
3. Run main.py to process the PDF file and generate the output.

Note: The US_Declaration.pdf file is required for the code to run properly.

This will extract the signer information from the PDF file and create a dictionary that maps each state to a list of signers.

# Output
The output will be printed to the console, with each state name and its associated signers on a new line.
